Estimates are available by security type and country for December 1984 through the most recent liabilities survey 
(foreign holdings of US securities) and for December 1994 through the most recent claims survey (US holdings of foreign securities). 
The data are updated every six months, when a new survey is released.  

In addition, the data may be updated periodically as a result of revisions to either the underlying flow data or 
changes in the valuation adjustments applied.  

The current estimates for foreign holdings of U.S. securities were last updated on March 26, 2012 to incorporate the preliminary results of the 
June 2011 Survey of foreign holdings of U.S. securities and the final December 2010 Survey of U.S. holdings of foriegn securities.
