Replication package for "Global Offshore Wealth, 2001 - 2021", by Souleymane Faye, Sarah Godar, and Gabriel Zucman.

Contained within this replication package is a collection of code designed to generate microdata files for the purpose of reproducing the data accessible on [Atlas of the Offshore World](https://atlas-offshore.world/) website, alongside the paper "Global Offshore Wealth, 2001 - 2021" authored by Faye, Godar, and Zucman in 2023. This code amalgamates information from a diverse set of origins (which will be delineated subsequently). ALl code files are intended for execution within the Stata environment.
